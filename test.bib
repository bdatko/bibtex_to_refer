              coupled chemical reaction channels. The method is a comp"act",

              particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of
              well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species
              participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For

              study non-linear chemical reaction processes in well-stirred
              homogeneous systems. We present the first treatment of diffusion,
              in the stochastic method, for non-linear reaction-diffusion
              processes. The derivation introduces mesoscopic rates of
              diffusion that are formally analogous to reaction rates. We "map",
              using Green's function, the bulk diffusion coefficient D in
              Fick's differential law to the corresponding transition rate
              probability for diffusion of a particle between finite volume
              elements. This generalized stochastic algorithm enables us to
              numerically calculate the time evolution of a spatially
              inhomogeneous mixture of reaction-diffusion species in a finite
              volume. The algorithm is equivalent to solving the time evolution
              of the spatially inhomogeneous master equation. A unique feature

              generated by a probability distribution determined by the
              intrinsic reaction kinetics and diffusion dynamics. To

               the basic ideas and definitions of classical or deterministic
               chemical kinetics. One of the basic questions to which chemists
               address themselves is the rate of chemical reactions, or in
               other words, how long it takes for a chemical reaction to attain
               completion, or equilibrium. Apparently the first significant
               quantitative investigation was made in 1850 by L. Wilhelmy [93].
               He studied the inversion of sucrose (cane sugar) in aqueous
               solutions of acids, whose reaction is He found empirically that
               the rate of decrease of concentration of sucrose was simply
               proportional to the concentration remaining unconverted, i.e.,
               if S(t) is the concentration of sucrose, then The constant of
               proportionality is called the rate constant of the reaction. If
               S o is the initial concentration of sucrose, then Since then an
               enormous number of reactions has been studied and the field of
               chemical kinetics is now one of the largest areas of chemical
               research. The importance of the field lies in the fact that it
               yields concise expressions for the time dependence of reactions,
               predicts yields, optimum economic conditions, and gives one much
               insight into the actual molecular processes involved. The

              several coumarin and rhodamine derivatives in aqueous solution
              were obtained by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence decay
              in a quartz cell. Furthermore, an epi-illuminated microscope,
              continuous wave (CW) excitation at 514.5 nm, and fluorescence
              correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a newly developed theory were
              used to study the photobleaching characteristics of rhodamines
              under conditions used for SMD. Depending on the rhodamine
              structure, the probability of photobleaching, p(b), is in the
              order of 10(-)(6)-10(-)(7) for irradiances below 10(3) W/cm(2).
              However, a considerable increase of p(b) for irradiances above

              photobleaching reactions from higher excited states (two-step

               a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent state on a time scale of
               seconds. This peculiar blinking behavior was observed in
               single-molecule fluorescence studies of GFP mutants in
               poly(acrylamide) gels (Dick"son", R. M.; et al. Nature 1997, 388,
               355.). Utilizing primarily the yellow-emitting phenolate anion
               mutant EGFP, we report new single-molecule experiments studying
               the effect of several parameters on the blinking process: pH,
               host matrix, and pumping intensity. The primary measurement in
               these studies is the observed distribution of on-times and
               off-times. The on-time dynamics of EGFP are independent of pH
               over the range of 6−10, thus making protonation/deprotonation of
               the chromophore unlikely as the source of the blinking. The
               excitation intensity, however, has a considerable effect on the
               blinking: the on-times are shorter at high intensity. We compare
               these results to ensemble bleaching measurements which find the
               bleaching quantum yield of EGFP in agarose gel at pH 8 to be (8
               $\pm$ 2) $\times$ 10-6. The probability of termination of

               filtering, various groups have directly visualized a variety of
               single fluorescent dye molecules (rhodamines [5-7,15,16,30-32]
               and coumarins [17,18,33]) dissolved in liquids by using coherent
               one- and two-photon excitation. Due to the high sensitivity and
               specificity, fluorescence is probably the most important optical
               readout mode in biological, scanning confocal microscopy. These
               unique features of fluorescence are critically dependent on the
               availability of appropriate fluorophores [34-40]. Photophysical
               parameters in general, and photobleaching or the photostability

               triplet-, and photobleaching quantum yield
               [17,18,41-44,47-53]. Photobleaching is a dynamic, mostly
               irreversible process in which fluorescent molecules undergo
               photoinduced chemical destruction upon absorption of light, thus
               losing their ability to fluoresce.",

  abstract  = "An iterative procedure has been developed for the numerical
               solution of the exact Smith-Ewart differential difference
               equations for a compartmentalised free-radical polymerisation
               reaction in the non-steady state. The procedure is of wide
               applicability, being capable of extension to include states of
               as high a radical-occupancy as is considered to be appropriate
               to the reaction system under consideration. The procedure is
               also in principle capable of application to reaction systems
               whose characterising parameters are time-dependent. Examples are
               given of results obtained using the procedure, and comparisons
               are made with the corresponding predictions of the Poissonian
               approximation described in a previous paper in this series.",

              that a conjugated polymer cannot contain more than one triplet.

@ARTICLE{Smith1948-kr,
  title     = "Kinetics of Emulsion Polymerization",
  author    = "Smith, Wendell V and Ewart, Roswell H",
  abstract  = "As a basis for understanding emulsion polymerization, the
               kinetics of free radical reactions in isolated loci is discussed
               subject to the condition that the free radicals are supplied to
               the loci from an external source. Three cases of interest are
               considered: that in which the average number of free radicals
               per locus is small compared with unity, that in which this
               number approximates one?half, and that in which the number is
               large. Of these three possibilities, the second, in which the
               free radicals per locus approximate one?half, is by far the most
               interesting as it explains in a satisfactory manner the
               characteristic features of styrene emulsion polymerization. For
               this case the average rate of reaction per locus is independent
               of the size of the locus, since this rate is simply one?half the
               rate of polymerization of a single free radical. Thus the rate
               of emulsion polymerization, the concentration of monomer in the
               loci, and the number of loci present provide the information
               needed for calculating the chain propagation constant for the
               monomer.A simplified treatment is given for approximating the
               number of reaction loci (polymer particles) produced in emulsion
               polymerization when the rate of polymerization per locus is
               constant (see case 2 above). The law obtained indicates that the
               number of particles should increase with the soap concentration
               (3/5ths power) and with the rate of formation of free radicals
               (2/5ths power), but should decrease with increasing rate of
               growth of the free radicals (?2/5ths power).",
